# ESUSU FINANCIAL SAVINGS & RENT

## Overview and Origin

* When was the company incorporated?...
	Founded in 2016, Esusu is at the forefront of paving a permanent bridge to financial access by providing financial solutions for low-to-middle income consumers.

* Who are the founders of the company?...
	Samir Goel (Indian American) and Wemimo Abbey (Nigerian) are the Co-Founders and Co-CEOs of Esusu. Prior to Esusu, Abbey founded Clean Water for Everyone, a global social venture providing affordable access to clean water for 250,000+ people in six countries, and Samir co-founded Transfernation, a nationally recognized non-profit that uses technology to ensure that excess food goes toward underserved communities across New York City.

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?...
	They started Esusu with the belief that where you come from, the color of your skin and your financial identity should not determine where you end up in life. As co-founders, Samir and Wemimo have shared personal experiences with financial marginalization that inspired us to create this platform. Samir’s family came to this country with no credit and were robbed upon arrival leaving them with no access to money. And when Wemimo immigrated to the United States from Lagos, Nigeria, his mother and did not have a financial identity or a credit score. They needed money but we were turned away from the banks because they did not have a financial history. His mother pawned her wedding ring and borrowed money from a payday loan lender at over 400% interest rate.
	Inspired by these experiences the ‘a-ha’ moment happened when they identified that the biggest barrier to entry in the financial system is not having a credit score. They knew that we wanted to leverage data to establish and boost credit profiles to unlock financial access for millions of Americans.
	Esusu's groundbreaking rent reporting platform captures rental payment data and reports it to credit bureaus to boost credit scores. This allows tenants to build and establish their credit scores while helping property owners attract tenants, reduce turnover, and improve collections to increase their operating income. Esusu creates the community and systems needed to build credit and thrive.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?...
	Esusu operates a B2B business model where they partner with public and private sector housing providers to capture rental payment history and report it to the credit bureaus. The landlords are willing to pay for their services given the value they provide in reducing missed and late payments, serving as an attraction/retention tool, and specifically for public sector landlords support with regulatory compliance. 
In August 2020, Esusu closed $2.3 million in seed extension bringing total capital raised to $4 million. Investors included Acumen Fund, Concrete Rose Capital, Global Good Fund, Impact America Fund, Next Play Ventures, and Zeal Capital Partners….

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?...
	Less than 1% of rental payments are reported to the major credit bureaus despite constituting the largest single monthly expenditure for American consumers and acting as a strong predictor of an individual’s credit risk. Esusu’s rent reporting platform captures rental payment data and reports it into the credit bureaus, enabling tenants to build credit while helping property owners increase revenue, lower evictions, and fill vacancies. 
	Also, Esusu’s 2nd app “Esusu Savings” allow peer-to-peer lending. It is a form of micro-finance savings, where you pool periodic cash contributions with other people, in which you all take ‘turn’ to receive the pot. Think of it as an interest-free savings account. The periodic contributions are also reported to the credit bureau which allow to raise you credit score.
